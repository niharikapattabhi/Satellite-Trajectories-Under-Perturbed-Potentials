# Geosynchronous Satellite Trajectories under Perturbed Gravitational Potentials

## Project Description

Welcome to the Geosynchronous Satellite Trajectories project! This Python project focuses on analyzing and computing the trajectories of geosynchronous satellites under perturbed gravitational potentials. The primary objective is to gain a deep understanding of how these trajectories behave in challenging and realistic settings. The project employs numerical methods to solve a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the `solve_ivp` command provided by the SciPy library.

## Project Structure

### Directory Structure

- **finals**: This folder contains the final implementation of the project code. These are the refined and optimized codes that produce the desired results.

### Experimental Codes

The rest of the project directory may contain various experimental codes and files that were developed during the research and development process. These experimental codes may include failed attempts, alternative approaches, or exploratory analyses. While these codes may not be part of the final project implementation, they may provide valuable insights into the project's evolution.

Please note that the codes in this project may not be perfect, and some results might be questionable or incorrect. However, this project is a part of my ongoing learning journey, and I am committed to improving and refining both the code and its results as I continue to learn and grow.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the 'finals' folder to access the final project implementation.
